1.first do it for one round
2. then figure out how u can do it fo 3 round
3. then for n round


4. for solving it for n rounds of ply ; u can keep track of clicks in other word:
    first. get number of rounds = n
    then. after n click on buttuns u print final result




n. when i learnt async i'll revisit it(solve this with functions)!
